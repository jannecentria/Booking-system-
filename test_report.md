# Penetration Testing Report: Registration Page

## Introduction

This report details the findings of the penetration testing performed on the **Registration Page** of the application. The goal was to uncover vulnerabilities such as **SQL Injection**, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, **Weak Password Handling**, and other potential flaws. The findings include descriptions of the vulnerabilities, their severity, and recommendations for mitigation.

## Test Environment

- **Application URL**: `http://localhost:8000/register`
- **Testing Date**: February 20, 2025
- **Testing Tools**: Burp Suite, ZAP, Manual Testing

---

## Vulnerabilities Identified

### 1. SQL Injection Vulnerability (High Risk)

- **Finding**: The application appears vulnerable to SQL Injection, particularly when the payload ` ' OR 1=1 -- ` was inserted into the `username` field.
- **Explanation**: This payload allowed bypassing authentication, enabling login without valid credentials.
- **Impact**: High. SQL injection could allow attackers to manipulate the database, bypass authentication, and potentially exfiltrate or alter sensitive data.
- **Recommendation**: Implement **prepared statements** or **parameterized queries** to protect against SQL injection. Ensure all user inputs are properly sanitized and validated before using them in SQL queries.

### 2. XSS Vulnerability (Reflected XSS)

- **Finding**: While attempting to inject an XSS payload (`<script>alert('XSS')</script>`) into the `username` field, no alert message appeared after registration.
- **Explanation**: This suggests that the application might be sanitizing inputs, but the absence of the alert doesn't conclusively rule out the presence of a Reflected XSS vulnerability. It's possible that the payload is being sanitized, or it could be reflected in different parts of the application.
- **Next Steps**:
  - Inspect the page source or use **Burp Suite** to check if the payload appears in the HTML response.
  - Test other fields (e.g., `password`, `role`) for potential reflections.
  - Store the payload in user profiles or other persistent storage to see if it gets reflected later when viewing the profile page.
- **Recommendation**: Ensure that **all user inputs are sanitized** or **escaped** properly before being rendered in the HTML. This will prevent Reflected XSS attacks.

### 3. Weak Password Handling (Medium Risk)

- **Finding**: The system allows weak passwords such as `12345`, `password`, and other easily guessable passwords.
- **Explanation**: Weak passwords make it easier for attackers to gain unauthorized access to user accounts, which could lead to account takeovers.
- **Impact**: Medium. Weak passwords increase the risk of unauthorized access via brute force or social engineering attacks.
- **Recommendation**: Implement a **strong password policy**:
  - Minimum length of 8-12 characters.
  - Require at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character.
  - Add a **password strength meter** to guide users in creating stronger passwords.

---

### 4. Long Input (Buffer Overflow/Input Validation Issue)

- **Finding**: The application successfully registered a user even when extremely long input was provided (e.g., `A*1000` in the `username` field).
- **Explanation**: This behavior could indicate a **buffer overflow** vulnerability or just a lack of proper input validation.
- **Impact**: Medium. Long inputs may cause buffer overflows or crashes, and they could be exploited to manipulate the system's behavior.
- **Recommendation**: Implement **input length validation**:
  - Set **maximum input lengths** for each field (e.g., username, password).
  - Validate input on both **client-side** (e.g., JavaScript) and **server-side** (e.g., backend code).

---

### 5. Special Character Handling (Low Risk)

- **Finding**: The system accepts special characters such as `!@#$%^&*()`.
- **Explanation**: While not necessarily a vulnerability, this could pose risks if the system doesn't properly handle or sanitize special characters.
- **Impact**: Low. Special characters could potentially lead to **XSS**, **Command Injection**, or other vulnerabilities if not handled correctly.
- **Recommendation**: Ensure that special characters are properly sanitized and **escaped** when used in any part of the system, especially in URLs, database queries, and HTML output.

## Conclusion

The application has several critical vulnerabilities that need to be addressed, particularly the **SQL Injection** and **Weak Password Handling** issues. These vulnerabilities can have severe consequences if left unaddressed. 

Other issues such as **XSS** and **input validation** require further investigation, but they should be treated as potential vulnerabilities until confirmed.

Immediate attention should be given to the following:
1. Implementing **prepared statements** for SQL queries.
2. Strengthening the **password policy** to require more complex passwords.
3. Ensuring all **user inputs** are properly sanitized to prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS).

Regular security audits and ongoing testing are recommended to maintain a high level of security.
